# eCommerce Data Science Assignment 🚀

Welcome to the eCommerce Data Science Assignment! This project focuses on analyzing eCommerce transaction data to generate insights, build predictive models, and segment customers effectively. Below are the tasks and instructions for the project

## 🛠️ Tasks

### **Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights** 📊
- Perform exploratory data analysis on the provided datasets (`Customers.csv`, `Products.csv`, and `Transactions.csv`).
- Generate at least 5 actionable business insights.
- Deliverables:
  - `EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing EDA code.
  - `EDA.pdf`: PDF report with insights and visualizations.

### **Task 2: Lookalike Model** 🤝
- Build a model that recommends 3 similar customers based on profile and transaction history.
- Deliverables:
  - `Lookalike.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook explaining model development.
  - `Lookalike.csv`: CSV file mapping CustomerID to top 3 lookalikes and similarity scores.

### **Task 3: Customer Segmentation** 🎯
- Use clustering techniques to segment customers based on profile and transaction data.
- Evaluate clusters using DB Index and visualize the results.
- Deliverables:
  - `Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with clustering code.
  - `Clustering.pdf`: PDF report with results, metrics, and visualizations.
